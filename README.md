# Machine Learning Workflow Automation  

## 📌 Overview  
This project automates the end-to-end machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing to model deployment. Built with **Python**, **scikit-learn**, and **TensorFlow**, the modular pipeline streamlines key stages, including data preparation, model training, evaluation, and deployment. AWS services are integrated for seamless cloud-based automation.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Data Preprocessing** – Handles missing values, feature engineering, and data normalization.  
✅ **Model Training** – Supports multiple ML models with hyperparameter tuning.  
✅ **Model Evaluation** – Generates performance metrics and visualizations.  
✅ **Automation** – Uses scripts for seamless training and deployment.  
✅ **Cloud Integration** – Deploys trained models on AWS for real-time inference.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: scikit-learn, TensorFlow  
- **Cloud Services**: AWS (S3, Lambda, API Gateway, SageMaker, or EC2)
